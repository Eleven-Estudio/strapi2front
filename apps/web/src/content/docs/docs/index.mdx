## Quick Example

After running `npx strapi2front sync`, you get:

```typescript
// Auto-generated types
interface Article {
  id: number;
  documentId: string;
  title: string;
  content: string;
  author: Author;
  publishedAt: string | null;
}

// Ready-to-use service
import { articleService } from '@/strapi/collections/article';

const articles = await articleService.find({
  filters: { title: { $contains: 'TypeScript' } },
  populate: ['author'],
});

// Zod schema for forms
import { articleCreateSchema } from '@/strapi/collections/article/schemas';

const form = useForm({
  resolver: zodResolver(articleCreateSchema),
});
```
