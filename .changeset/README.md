# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code.

## How to create a changeset

```bash
pnpm changeset
```

This will ask you which packages have changed, what kind of change it is (major, minor, patch), and for a summary.
